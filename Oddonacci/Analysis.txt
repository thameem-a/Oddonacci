1. Multiple Recursive Algorithm:
The multiple-recursive algorithm shows exponential growth in execution time. As the input value n increases, the time required grows exponentially.
For instance, Oddonacci(5) takes approximately 1.4 million nanoseconds, while Oddonacci(45) takes over 876 billion nanoseconds. 
This is a result of the algorithm recalculating the same values multiple times, leading to a time complexity of O(3^n).
This makes the multiple-recursive approach impractical for large values of n.

2. Linear Recursive Algorithm:
The linear-recursive algorithm shows consistent linear growth in execution time. 
While it performs better than the multiple-recursive version, it is still slower than the tail-recursive approach.
For example, Oddonacci(5) takes 4,325 nanoseconds, and Oddonacci(45) takes 19,265 nanoseconds.
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), as it avoids the repeated computation of previous values by carrying forward intermediate results.

3. Tail-Recursive Algorithm:
The tail-recursive algorithm consistently performs the best among the three approaches. 
It has the lowest execution time for all tested values of n, demonstrating the efficiency of this approach.
For example, Oddonacci(5) takes 2,832 nanoseconds, and even for larger inputs like Oddonacci(45), it takes only 6,534 nanoseconds.
The tail-recursive method optimizes the function call stack by reusing the same stack frame, which allows it to handle large values of n efficiently with a linear time complexity O(n).

However, after many attempts the furthest my machine could run was Oddonacci(45) in approx. 10 minutes, letting it run for about 5 minutes after, my laptop fan started to spin increasingly and after 20 minutes no return was outputted. However, from my many attempts I was able to conclude that Oddonacci(30) was the most consistent and furthest my machine could output after immodestly pressing run.
